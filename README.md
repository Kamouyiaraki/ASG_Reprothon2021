### Contributors Guide

#### What is the Task (Vision Statement

I’m working with [community, allies, contributors] to [make, build, teach, or do something] so that [audience, end users, consumers, community members] can [do something different, achieve a goal].
[benefits of this] 
[challenges of this] - not all code is reproducible/not all data structures are.
[Who you’re doing it for, your audience (may be same as the previous question)]
[Why you’re doing this, the impact or change you hope to make]
I'm working open because....

#### When and Where 

As with everything, `ASG Reprothon 2021` will be hosted online on MS Teams. 
This will be hosted between 4 and 6 pm BST on Wednesday the XX of XX. 

The session will be open for all contributors to pop in and out in the own time and will provide a space to chat with other contributors, but also watch real-time as the project moves forward. 
However, this is all open access so you will be able to take part at your own pace, whenever you want. All data is hosted on Github and the website. Any issues can then be brought up on our github by oepning an issue. 
[tutorial on how to open an issue - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Bl54_Xxis&t=4s&ab_channel=MozillaScienceLab] 

A hard deadline will be announced before the data is taken down to be analysed. 


### Your role as a `Contributor`

Contributors are volunteers who offer their time and expertise to the hackathon project. All contributions are central to the project as they move work forward by leaps and bounds! 

As a contributor you might: 

- add your own unique perspective to the project plans and ideas
- help with the research 
- create graphics an mock ups
- contribute code 
- contribute mock data for testing out code

You should be aware that all contributions to the project will fall under the project's [license]() and can be reused, remixed and shared according to that license. 


#### Requirements

- good WiFi or some way of connecting to the Internet
- R version 4.0+ (if you need to update R you can do that following the guide [here](https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/installR.html#:~:text=finish%20the%20installation.-,From%20within%20RStudio%2C%20go%20to%20Help%20%3E%20Check%20for%20Updates%20to,)%2C%20and%20click%20Install%20Updates))
- ability to install packages in R

*Optional*: A Github Account (this is free). You will still be able to access all the infromation on Github, but if you want to propose any changes or bring up any issues 



### Finding Tasks and Collaborating

At the Reprothon you will use Google sheets to access tasks and note down your findings!

At the moment through registration you will be designated a subset of the dataset that you can work through (you don't have to go through them all!) 
If you want to Collaborate with other contributors you can let the organisers know in advance and we'll group you together, or if you want to collaborate with people in the moment you will have complete freedom to do so! How you split up the work and what roles people take will be entirely up to you!
[how are we going to designate posts to people]


[insert a gif of working the drop-down menus in the google sheet Thomas has prepared]

Finally, all results will be uploaded to the `ASG Reprothon 2021` Github and Website, but you can learn more about the data in advance by checking out the data description already there [links;links]


#### Sharing your story

Part of the “open” nature of the hackathon is connecting and sharing our work, processes an experiences. During the event, we encourage you to post updates– both in the MS Teams chat, and on social media.
You can follow the #reprothon2021 hashtag on Twitter to see what others are up to.

If you want a look at what a previous hackathon was like, our founder [Francesca Mancini](link) shared her experience in 2017 as a [blog](https://francescamancini.github.io/MozSprint/)
