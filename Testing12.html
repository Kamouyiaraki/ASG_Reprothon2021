<p>Hackathon on reproducibility and longevity of R code for the Aberdeen Study Group - 2021.</p>

<h3 id="who-we-are">Who we are</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/studyGroup/">Aberdeen Study Group</a> is a <a href="https://www.mozillascience.org/">Mozilla Science Lab</a> Study Group.<br />
We are based at the University of Aberdeen, but we organise fun, informal meetups open to <strong>everyone, anywhere</strong> to share skills, stories and ideas on using code for research. The goal is to create a friendly, no-pressure environment where people can share their work, ask for help on a coding problem, and learn and work together with their peers.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-it-all-about">What is it all about?</h3>

<p>Reproducibility is important across all research, whether this is open access articles, repeatable results or giving access to code and data used for a paper. However, if you have ever tried to rerun old code and it has failed, you are not alone! 
<br />
So what can we do maximise the longevity, and therefore reproducibility, of our code? That is what the ASG Reprothon 2021 aims to answer! Collating data on code reproducibility for the first time, the Reprothon will provide robust evidence on what factors are determining the longevity of code. 
<br />
At the end of this we hope to share the results with the aim to provide researchers with guidelines to ensure their code remains usable beyond publishing.
<br />
<br />
If you want a look at what a previous hackathon for MozSprint was like, our founder <a href="https://github.com/FrancescaMancini">Francesca Mancini</a> shared her experience in 2017 as a <a href="https://francescamancini.github.io/MozSprint/">blog</a></p>

<h3 id="how-to-contribute">How to contribute</h3>

<p>The Reprothon is ASG’s very own hackathon! A hackathon is an event where lots of people come together to work on a coding or programming problem. In our Reprothon, we are aiming to determine what factors affect the reproducibility of R code. To do this, participants will work through queries taken from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>, checking whether or not the accepted answer still works. Each participant will input this into the master <a href="https://aberdeenstudygroup.github.io/Reprothon2021/sheet.html">spreadsheet</a> along with details such as the package used. We will track our progress live, and after the closing date, the organisers will analyse this data and produce a blog with our findings.</p>

<p><strong>Where</strong>: MSTeams</p>

<p><strong>When</strong>: in person 9th June 2021, 1600-1800 BST, and will remain live until <em>TBC</em></p>

<p>If you want to get involved, we have a quick <a href="LINK">registration form</a> to complete, which when completed will provide you with your unique Reprothon ID. 
<br />
<br />
The session will be open for all contributors to pop in and out in their own time and will provide a space to chat with other contributors, but also watch real-time as the project moves forward.</p>

<h4 id="requirements">Requirements</h4>
<p>This event is open to anyone interested! However, as it will be focused on testing code there are a few requirements you might need to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>good WiFi or some way of connecting to the Internet</li>
  <li>R version 4.0+ (if you need to update R you can do that following the guide <a href="https://uvastatlab.github.io/phdplus/installR.html">here</a> )</li>
  <li>ability to install packages in R</li>
  <li>familiarity with StackOverlow posts</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Optional</em>: A Github Account (this is free). You will still be able to access all the infromation on Github, but if you want to propose any changes or bring up any issues</p>

<h3 id="your-role-as-a-contributor">Your role as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Contributor</code></h3>

<p>Contributors are volunteers who offer their time and expertise to the hackathon project. All contributions are central to the project as they move work forward by leaps and bounds!</p>

<p>As a contributor you might:</p>

<ul>
  <li>add your own unique perspective to the project plans and ideas</li>
  <li>help with the research</li>
  <li>create graphics an mock ups</li>
  <li>contribute code</li>
  <li>contribute mock data for testing out code</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be aware that all contributions to the project will fall under the project’s <a href="https://github.com/AberdeenStudyGroup/Reprothon2021/blob/main/LICENSE">license</a> and can be reused, remixed and shared according to that license.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-your-story">Sharing your story</h3>

<p>Part of the “open” nature of the hackathon is connecting and sharing our work, processes and experiences. During the event, we encourage you to post updates– both in the MS Teams chat, and on social media.
<br />
You can follow the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#reprothon2021</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#hackers2021</code> hashtags on Twitter to see what others are up to.</p>
